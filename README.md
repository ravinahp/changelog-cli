- (Optional) Anthropic API Key for AI-enhanced changelogs ([Get one here](https://console.anthropic.com/))

## Installation

### Install from npm (Coming Soon)

```bash
npm install -g instalog
```

### Install from source

1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/instalog.git
cd instalog
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Create a symbolic link to make it executable globally (optional):
```bash
npm link
```

### Configuration

There are two ways to configure InstaLog:

#### Option 1: Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file in the root directory with your Anthropic API key:

```
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_anthropic_api_key
```

#### Option 2: Interactive Setup
Simply run the tool, and you'll be prompted to enter your:
- GitHub Personal Access Token (if not found)
- Anthropic API Key (if not found and you want to use AI enhancement)

You can choose to save these keys for future use.

## Usage

Run the CLI with:

```bash
instalog
# or

2. Select the timeframe for your changelog
3. Choose the changelog format (Internal or External)
4. Enable or disable AI enhancement (if Anthropic API key is configured)
5. Edit the changelog (if desired)
6. Publish the changelog

## AI-Enhanced Changelogs

When the Anthropic API key is provided, InstaLog can use Claude AI to:

- Better categorize and group similar changes
- Summarize complex changes in a more readable format
- Prioritize important changes and filter out noise
- Generate more coherent and professional-looking changelogs
- Adapt the language and detail level based on the target audience (developers vs. users)

## Changelog Formats

### Internal Format

Designed for developers, the internal format includes:

- Commit hashes
- Author information
- Timestamps
